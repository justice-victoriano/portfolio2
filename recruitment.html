                <h2>THETA PHI ALPHA RECRUITMENT VIDEO</h2>
                <p>As the videographer of Theta Phi Alpha at The College of New Jersey, I was tasked with creating a Spring Recruitment video that would promote the sorority to potential new members. I collected clips from the members, filmed the introduction and ending, and edited the video. The video is posted on the organization’s official YouTube page and shared on Instagram and Facebook.

                    <p>Collecting footage from the members of the organization was the most difficult part of the project since I was relying on them for the majority of the content. Since the clips came from different people, it was important that I added something that would make the video feel more cohesive. I decided to film an introduction and an ending with my Canon T7i. After I collected all the footage, I edited and color corrected the video in Premiere. I incorporated jump cuts, match cuts, strobe effects, transitions, and animations.</p>

            <p>The zoom effect was done by layering the polaroid video (video 1) and the video of the girl (video 2). I masked video 1 and gradually changed the opacity of video 2 as the camera was getting closer to the polaroid. I also added a blur and a flashing light effect to further dramatize the zoom effect.

        <div class="caption-3">
            <p>I incorporated pre-made animations and masked them to appear behind people in the clips—I wanted the animations to seem as though they were completely immersed in the scene.
