                <p>The video features the sisters of Theta Phi Alpha from The College of New Jersey thanking essential workers for their hard work. The organization’s chaplain and I wrote the script, and each clip was recorded by the speaker. I edited the video using Premiere Pro. The video is posted on the organization’s official YouTube page and shared on Instagram and Facebook.

            <div class="description">
                <p>The idea of making a thank you video emerged when one of the members of the organization shared how her mother, a nurse, had become very overwhelmed by the conditions of her work environment. In response, the organization wanted to create a thank you video expressing their gratitude to her and all essential workers. </p>
